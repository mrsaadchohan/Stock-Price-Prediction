# Stock Market Prediction using LSTM
## Overview
### This project implements a stock market prediction system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The model forecasts stock prices based on historical data.The project follows an end-to-end pipeline, incorporating a FastAPI backend and a Streamlit frontend for user interaction.
## Features
### Stock Price Prediction: Uses LSTM to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
### FastAPI Backend: Serves the prediction model via API endpoints.
### Streamlit Frontend: Provides an interactive UI for users to visualize predictions.
### Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and transforms time-series inputs.
## Tech Stack
### Backend: FastAPI, Python
### Frontend: Streamlit
### Machine Learning: TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM), Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
### Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
